### Automatic Clustering Framework ###

### Version 1.0 ###
The provided code represents the process of evolving clusters and migration of data points to other groups during different stages of the proposed framework called "Automatic Data Clustering Framework Using Nature-Inspired Binary Optimization Algorithms". The proposed framework is a part of an ongoing reserach in automatic data clustering for correlated content and another related reserach in the area of the cache-aided networks.
example 1 of the submitted manuscript, and we believe it completely elaborates the proposed framework on a small scale. We keep the repository updated during the next stages, and we can publicly release the entire code after finishing the next research for the purpose of reproducibility.

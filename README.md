### Automatic Data Clustering Framework ###
Revision 1.0. 

We share this code only for research use.

### About ###

This code represents the process of evolving clusters and migration of data points to other groups during different stages under the proposed framework called "Automatic Data Clustering Framework Using Nature-Inspired Binary Optimization Algorithms". The proposed method is recently submitted to the IEEE Access Journal and it is still under review process.
This framework is a part of an ongoing reserach in automatic data clustering for correlated content and another related reserach in the area of the cache-aided networks.
We keep the repository updated during the next stages, and we can publicly release the rest of the code after finishing the next research for the purpose of reproducibility.

## Get the source
Clone the Git repository from GitHub

    git clone https://github.com/.git

##  Usage
This code should work on Windows or Linux, with MATLAB.
Run main.m
You can see the final result after a few iterations.
